* Education as a higher purpose in people's lives
* there is a culture in which education is just a mean, with a single goal directed at employment
* you study just for having a good job and wellfare and nothing more

#### Topics

* legislation "no child left behind"
* Education not just an economic issue
* dropout crisis
* dominant education culture
* testing rather than learning
* standardization culture that kills the disciplines
* where are the geniuses of our time?
* curiosity importance in learning
* curiosity and imagination are essential for creativity
* the teacher role
* task and achievement
* the needed for more individualized education
* education problems are solved with educational methods that at least look at reality, and not merely political actions

#### Comments

* I agree with almost everything the speaker said
* the speaker is an educator, so he limits the solution to school only without looking at the problem in a broader and more historical perspective
* education is much bigger than school
* it's much more than studyning content and taking an exam
* education is learning, but not only in the intellectual sense, but moral, physical and spiritual
* it's growing, integral development as a human being
* the school can't do that, even if it wanted to
* Aristotle
    * the knoledge of world comes from our senses
    * it's impossible to pass a thought to other person
* you have a thought, and you communicate it to other person, so that person builds him thought
* the quality of communication will determine whether the two thoughts are similar
* learning is really a lonely act
* there's a misconception, that learning depends on a teacher who "teaches" you
* as if learning and teaching were the same thing
* a teacher teaches you something, and you need to study it in deep to learn
* but teachers actually teach for the test
* why are you reading this book? for the test
* sounds like idealism, but actually we already had it and lost
* the dominant educational culture has abandoned the 3R's system and any classic teaching model
